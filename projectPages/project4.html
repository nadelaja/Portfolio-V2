            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>Order Up! is a fast-paced card game where players compete as chefs to complete recipes using ingredient
                cards. The game features simultaneous play mechanics, creating an exciting rush to complete recipes
                before other players. With a mix of strategic resource management and quick decision-making, players
                must balance their ingredient collection while watching out for penalty cards that could derail their
                progress.</p>

            <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
            <p>The core gameplay revolves around matching ingredient cards to recipe requirements. Players start with 7
                ingredient cards and compete to complete the currently revealed recipe. Special mechanics include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wildcard "Fully Stocked Fridge" cards that can substitute any ingredient</li>
                <li>Penalty cards that force discards (One Star Review) or recipe forfeitures (Health Code Violation)
                </li>
                <li>Dynamic hand management with continuous drawing and discarding</li>
                <li>Simultaneous play format that creates engaging player interaction</li>
            </ul>

            </div>

            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>The game underwent significant evolution through multiple playtesting sessions:</p>

            <h3>Initial Version</h3>
            <p>The first iteration included trading mechanics and strict hand limits, which proved to slow down
                gameplay. Early playtesting revealed issues with recipe completion difficulty and card distribution.</p>

            <h3>Refinements</h3>
            <p>Through iterative testing, several key improvements were made:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simplified recipe requirements for better game flow</li>
                <li>Added wildcards to prevent gameplay stagnation</li>
                <li>Introduced penalty cards for player interaction</li>
                <li>Adjusted ingredient card distribution for better balance</li>
                <li>Modified win conditions for more satisfying gameplay</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Card Distribution</h2>
            <p>The final game features carefully balanced card quantities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>26 Recipe Cards with varying complexity</li>
                <li>56 Ingredient Cards spread across 12 different types</li>
                <li>6 Wildcard "Fully Stocked Fridge" cards</li>
                <li>6 Penalty Cards (3 each of two types)</li>
                <li>Recipe requirements ranging from 1-3 ingredients</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Playtesting Insights</h2>
            <p>Multiple playtesting sessions with 2-4 players revealed valuable insights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Need for clear rules about card placement and timing</li>
                <li>Importance of round reset procedures</li>
                <li>Balance between game speed and strategic depth</li>
                <li>Accessibility considerations leading to planned illustrations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Development</h2>
            <p>Current plans for further development include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding illustrations for improved accessibility</li>
                <li>Upgrading to cardstock for better durability</li>
                <li>Potential expansion with new recipe and ingredient combinations</li>
                <li>Exploring additional special card mechanics</li>
            </ul>
