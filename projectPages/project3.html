                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>A Night at Home is an interactive narrative fiction game, also known as a choice-based or branching
                    narrative game.
                    This genre of storytelling allows readers to actively participate in shaping the narrative through
                    their choices,
                    creating a personalized journey through the story. Unlike linear fiction, where readers passively
                    follow a
                    predetermined path, branching narratives offer multiple potential storylines that diverge and
                    converge based on
                    reader decisions.</p>

                <h2>Version 2.0 Enhancements</h2>
                <p><i>A Night at Home 2.0</i> represents a significant evolution of the original Twine game, rebuilt as
                    part of my
                    graduate student project. Key improvements include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A three-page structure featuring a welcoming home page, a gates page for quick navigation, and
                        an
                        immersive story page</li>
                    <li>Custom visual elements replacing standard Twine 2 animations</li>
                    <li>Enhanced navigation options throughout the experience</li>
                    <li>Save functionality (currently in debugging)</li>
                    <li> Planned audio implementation</li>
                </ul>

                <div>
                    <h2>Experience the Story</h2>
                    <p>Alone at night in your quiet, empty house, a noise pulls you from your thoughts. Do you brush it
                        off and
                        try to sleep, or let curiosity pull you deeper into the shadows? A Night at Home is an
                        interactive game
                        that challenges players to navigate a maze of creeping dread and uneasy choices. As the house
                        shifts
                        around you, and strange events draw you toward something sinister, it's up to you to decide how
                        far
                        you'll go when fear gnaws at the edges of your sanity. Will you face the darkness, or will you
                        turn away
                        and hope it's only your imagination?</p>

                        what lurks in the
                        darkness of your own home.</p>

                <h2>Development Process & Playtesting</h2>
                <p>The development process was heavily informed by player feedback through multiple iterations:</p>

                <h3>Early Testing</h3>
                <p>Key feedback from early testing helped shape the narrative structure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>dentified issues with passage length, leading to more digestible segments</li>
                    <li>Suggested incorporating choices within the text rather than just at passage ends</li>
                    <li>Recommended varying the presentation of player options to maintain engagement</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Later Testing</h3>
                <p>Further refinements based on additional testing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Further text optimization for better pacing</li>
                    <li>Suggested implementing a "true bad ending" where the player is consumed by the dark entity</li>
                    <li>Confirmed appropriate gameplay duration (approximately 10 minutes per route)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Results & Impact</h3>
                <p>Playtesting showed players felt invested in their choices, with the familiar home setting deepening
                    their connection.
                    The branching narrative encouraged replayability as players explored different paths.</p>

                <h2> Challenges</h2>

                <p>Creating effective interactive horror meant balancing tension with meaningful choices, making sure
                    each decision felt
                    significant while maintaining a coherent narrative.
                </p>

                <h3>Passage Length and Pacing</h3>
                <p>Managing the length of passages was key to keeping the narrative moving smoothly. Through
                    playtesting, I refined these
                    sections to strike the right balance between atmosphere, context, and engagement, ensuring the
                    pacing stayed consistent
                    without overwhelming the reader.</p>

                <h3>Twine to Custom Implementation</h3>
                <p>The game was ported from Twine to a custom interface using Lazerwalker's <a class="outgoing-link"
                        target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lazerwalker/twison">Twison</a>
                    story format to export the narrative to JSON. This process, while challenging, gave me the freedom
                    to create a
                    more personalized and thematic user experience.
                </p>

                <h3>Custom UI Development</h3>
                <p>Developing a custom UI required balancing aesthetics and functionality. The interface was designed to
                    enhance the horror
                    atmosphere while remaining intuitive, featuring custom navigation, save functionality, and seamless
                    visual transitions.</p>
